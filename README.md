## Description

This was our project exam for the first year at Noroff. The task was to make a blog, with us being able to have whatever theme we wanted to. I decided to create a knitting/cabin-life theme, with the feeling I was going for being a warm and cozy vibe. We had to use WP Rest API and setting up our blog post through that, and then fetch it to our newly made blog. We also had to make a carousel, and a "read more" post to show the remaining posts. Lastly, we had to make a contact form with JS validation.
